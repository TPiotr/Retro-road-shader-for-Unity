# Retro road shader for Unity
Its just shader so its pretty fast and run smoothly on my android phone (Xiaomi Redmi note 4), this shader is modified and adapted to work with unity version of this [one](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/XtlGW4).
You can customize colors, size, curve etc of road to achieve what you want. You can use this in game as normal road just modify _RoadTime and _Curve properties in real time (f.e. RoadTime as speed of player)

(In recorded scene I was using some postprocessing effects like fxaa, vignette to achieve nicer looking road)
