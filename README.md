# Retro road shader for Unity
Its just shader so its pretty fast and run smoothly on my android phone (Xiaomi Redmi note 4), this shader is modified version of 
this [one](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/XtlGW4).
You can customize colors, size, curve etc of road to achieve what you want. You can use this in game as normal road just modify _RoadTime and _Curve properties in real time (f.e. RoadTime is speed of player)
