# Retro road shader for Unity
Its just shader so its pretty fast and run smoothly on my android phone (Xiaomi Redmi note 4), this shader is modified and adapted to work with unity version of this [one](https://www.shadertoy.com/view/XtlGW4).
You can customize colors, size, curve etc of road to achieve what you want. You can use this in game as normal road just modify _RoadTime and _Curve properties in real time (f.e. RoadTime as speed of player)

# How to use
To use this in your project just download and paste Road folder into your Assets folder inside your project, then drag and drop prefab to your scene or just apply material onto some sprite.
